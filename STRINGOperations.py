#indices and slicing

# stringgs are immutable, canot reassign characters after a string has been defined.
# device_id_length = len("h32rb17")

# The str() and len() functions are useful for working with strings. You can also apply methods to strings, including the .upper(), .lower(), and .index() methods. A method is a function that belongs to a specific data type.
# print("r45rt46".index("r"))
