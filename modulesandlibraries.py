# A module is a set of code or functions with the.py extension. A library is a collection of related modules or packages. They are used by both programmers and developers. Libraries are used by community members, developers and researchers.

# python standard library modules: re , csv , glob , os , time , datetime are few of the modules
#we can also download additional modules.
# import re
# import csv
# import glob
# import os
# import datetime
# import time
# Another Python Standard Library module is statistics. The statistics module includes functions used when calculating statistics related to numeric data. For example, mean() is a function in the statistics module that takes numeric data as input and calculates its mean (or average). Additionally, median() is a function in the statistics module that takes numeric data as input and calculates its median (or middle value).
# import statistics
# monthly_failed_attempts = [20, 17, 178, 33, 15, 21, 19, 29, 32, 15, 25, 19]
# mean_failed_attempts = statistics.mean(monthly_failed_attempts)
# median_failed_attempts = statistics.median(monthly_failed_attempts)
# mode_failed_attempts = statistics.mode(monthly_failed_attempts)
# print("mean:", mean_failed_attempts)
# print("median:", median_failed_attempts)
# print("mode:", mode_failed_attempts)
# from statistics import median, mean, mode
# monthly_failed_attempts = [20, 17, 178, 33, 15, 21, 19, 29, 32, 15, 25, 19]
# mean_failed_attempts = mean(monthly_failed_attempts)
# print("mean:", mean_failed_attempts)
# median_failed_attempts = median(monthly_failed_attempts)
# print("median:", median_failed_attempts)
